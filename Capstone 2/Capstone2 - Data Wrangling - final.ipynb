    "# Capstone 2: Data Wrangling\n",
    "## Dog Adoption Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "[Kaggle - Dog Adoption](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/dog-adoption)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Collection (Load data. Join/merge data.)\n",
    "2. Organization (File structure. GitHub. Hint: the glob library could come in handy here)\n",
    "3. Data Definition (Column names, Data types, Description of the columns, Counts and percents unique values, Ranges of values, Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range, and number of unique values))\n",
    "4. Data Cleaning (NA or missing values, Duplicates)\n",
    "* Helpful commands:\n",
    "  - loc[] - filter your data by label\n",
    "  - iloc[] - filter your data by indexes\n",
    "  - apply() - execute a function across an axis of a DataFrame\n",
    "  - drop() - drop columns from a DataFrame \n",
    "  - is_unique() - check if a column is a unique identifier\n",
    "  - str.contains()\n",
    "  - str.extract()\n",
    "  - .where()\n",
    "  - df.isnull().values.any()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Big questions to start with:\n",
    "1. How many of each type and breed of dog are brought into shelters across the USA in a given year?\n",
    "2. Which states have the most imports of dogs and what breeds/types are they?\n",
    "3. Are there any trends in the types/breeds of dogs being brought into shelters? (e.g. more pit bulls than golden retrievers)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Small questions to explore:\n",
    "1. Categorize breeds based on size? Do large or small dogs tend to be imported/exported/in shelters?\n",
    "2. Which type of dog is popular in which state?\n",
    "3. Which breeds are most represented? What happens if we drop the outliers?"

      "Elliot is a sweet boy who is just starting to come out of his shell.  He has learned to walk on leash  and especially loves to walk with another dog along.  He is not house trained but is fairly clean in his run so he should learn fairly easily.  Elliot loves to run in the dog park and is being introduced to toys.  He was initially shy with new people but is getting more confident and outgoing.  Elliot would love a home with a big fenced yard and another dog to play with, and he does love a comfortable bed at night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
      "We would love you to meet Sweet Pea. This little beauty is almost 6 years old. She was found wondering the streets with her siblings. She wants a forever home that will love and care for her. She is shy at times but its a big world. She is hoping that her forever family will come and adopt her, so that she can explore just a small peice of the world. She would love to go to a forever home with lots of love. She will have to be the only dog in the home doesn't do well with other dogs. Sweet Pea will need to go to a home with no children, she doesn't seem to understand them and gets to excited around them.

      "Meet Vicky! She doesn't trust the government, believes in UFOs, has a sneaking suspicion the mailman is spying on her, which is why she tells her friends to hand deliver any and all packages. So, if you're ready to be the one she trusts to share her theories of the government with, to be the one to look for UFOs with, and to be the one who will hand deliver her tennis balls to her, then please take this sweet girl home.

If you are serious about adopting, visit our website wbcrescue.org to read more about this dog and our adoption process, and to submit an application. Thanks for considering adoption!\\n\\nBeautiful Echo, like True, is a holdover from before WBCR closed in 2016. Like True, she remained with a foster family all this time. She is now ready and looking for her forever home, where she can be cherished. Echo is a special girl who will require a special family: she is fearful and reactive towards unfamiliar people, and like many female BCs, can be touchy with other dogs, although with careful management she peaceably cohabitates with several other dogs in her foster home. She loves her human friends and she is a total ball-a-holic. SheÃ¢Â€Â™s got all kind of skills Ã¢Â€Â“ housetrained, crate-trained, basic manners Ã¢Â€Â“ and sheÃ¢Â€Â™s not a super high energy girl at all. Echo will require a savvy, experienced owner and a quiet situation, but we know the right family is out there for this glamorous girl!\\n\\nFor more info about Echo, to read about our adoption process, or to submit an application, visit wbcrescue.org                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

       "Manny is a cute little guy, neutered male @ 12 lbs, @4-5 years old.  He is friendly with everyone he knows, but he takes a bit of time to get to know/trust strangers.  He can be moody which is common for chihuahuas.  He is good with other friendly dogs though he must be fed separately and left alone while he is eating.  He does have some resource aggression and needs to be left alone while he is eating or enjoying chews.  No children due to this behavior.  Manny will be a wonderful smaller companion dog for a lucky person who understands his temperament.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
       "Buddy is a young Portuguese Podengo.  At just over a year, he loves to be held and is good with other dogs and scared of the cat.  He is crate trained and mostly house trained.  Buddy doesn't do well with little children as he doesn't like loud noises and quick movements towards him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
       "You can fill out an adoption application online on our official website.Please contact Lynn & Cedric (lynnwelcomesyouhome@gmail.com) for more information about this pet.\\n\\nAll of our dogs and cats are in foster homes and we have no paid staff. If you have questions concerning a specific animal, PLEASE fill out an application and the foster parent will be in touch. We will not arrange any home visits with any of our dogs and cats until your application is processed. Please understand our foster parents are precious to our 2nd Chance family; without them we cannot function, so we do our best to not burden them with multiple appointments. Our foster parents will choose their top 3 applications and arrange home visits with these applicants. The adopter will be chosen at that time. The process can take anywhere from a week to a month. We want to make sure our little furry ones are placed in their \\\"forever home\\\" and never have to go through a rehoming again!\\n\\nUPDATE - Nick has been diagnosed with Addisons. He will be on meds the rest of his life. Cost is about $250 per month. He feels so great after his monthly shot.Hi! My name is Nick. I guess you would like to know a little about me and my story. I somehow found myself in a high kill shelter a few months ago. After a few days in the shelter when no one came to get me, they put a slip on my kennel that said I was next to be euthanized if more dogs came into the shelter. Luckily a nice shelter worker contacted 2nd Chance 4 Life and my new foster mom and her friend drove 7 hours each way to come get me! I was so happy to be out of the loud shelter that I slept like a baby the entire way home! As you can tell I am on the older side, but don't let that deter you. I have been told by everyone I meet that I am a sweet old soul. I love curling up into a little ball and sleeping on anything comfy. Did I mention I like to sleep A LOT? I am most happy on a nice warm couch next to my human. I get scared and anxious when I am home alone, and would prefer if someone would stay home with me during the day! Maybe an older soul like me will give me a chance and all the snuggles I could ever want! I like other dogs, and they seem to like me too. I am house trained, I can sit, shake with both paws, and come on command. Please give me a chance to show you that old dogs are just as fun and loving as a young puppy. You wont regret it! - NickPlease fill out an adoption application:\\nAdoption application (Dog)\\nAdoption Application (Cat)\\n\\nPlease understand we do not adopt out dogs to\\nfamilies with children under the age of 5. We do not adopt dogs to renters. Some dogs will have fence requirements while others may not.\\n\\nA pet is a lifetime commitment. The dogs and cats in our system find themselves there, for the most part, because their humans did not have the same loyalty to them as they did to their owners. We do not take the adoption process lightly, and will do everything in our power to make sure the animal is placed correctly the first time around for your sake and theirs. Thank you for choosing to adopt not shop!     1\n",

She is now ready and looking for her forever home, where she can be cherished. Echo is a special girl who will require a special family: she is fearful and reactive towards unfamiliar people, and like many female BCs, can be touchy with other dogs, although with careful management she peaceably cohabitates with several other dogs in her foster home. She loves her human friends and she is a total ball-a-holic. SheÃ¢Â€Â™s got all kind of skills Ã¢Â€Â“ housetrained, crate-trained, basic manners Ã¢Â€Â“ and sheÃ¢Â€Â™s not a super high energy girl at all.

He, his 10 siblings and mother were saved by a wonderful rescue lady in China and together we are working on getting them all to the safety of GaDaH-CHINA in Sebec, Maine. We pay to get these dogs vetted, tested, quarantined and all other requirements to import them to the safety of the rescue in Sebec, Maine. The adoption fee's vary slightly depending on the weight and size of the dogs. HUA-HUA adoption fee is US $550 and covers the costs we incur to save these precious souls.\\n\\nHUA-HUA has been through the export and import quarantine requirements from China to the US. He has his rabies, core vaccines/lepto, heartworm, tick-disease and screw worm tested negative. He has been de-wormed, micro chipped and received any necessary monthly preventatives. He has an estimated date of birth of 2 January 2018 and he weighs around 24 pounds. His mother we believe is a Belgian Shepherd and so he is most likely a Belgian Shepherd Dog Mix, we have no idea what breed the father is. It is up to you to look at him and decide what breed you think he could be. He arrived in the United States on 23rd August 2018, landing at JFK and then was driven up to the rescue in Sebec, Maine. We are looking for families with knowledge of experience of working breed needs to ensure they get a good balance of mental and physical exercise.\\n\\nHUA-HUA is a cautious boy, but once he has gained trust and feels safe he is very affectionate and loving. He likes to climb on your knee, or snuggle up on the bed, but has always been with his siblings. He will need time to get used to new people and new places, but once trust has been gained he is a great all round boy.\\n\\nWE DO NOT HAVE CATS OR LIVESTOCK AT THE RESCUE SO ARE UNABLE TO COMMENT ON HOW HE WILL ACT NEAR OR AROUND THEM.\\n\\nHe does use the dog door to get in and out and does go outside to do his business. I do not know if he would let you know he needs to go out since he has 24/7 access to the outside, but he is extremely smart and do not think it would take long to learn, so a few initial accidents in his new home whilst he adjusts and gets used to his new routine and has his family teach him to let them know he wants to go outside should be expected. Until arriving at GaDaH, he had never been an inside dog.\\n\\nHe would benefit from a family who understands the importance of mental stimulation as well as physical exercise. As with all rescue's he needs guidance and training and we recommend families go through at least the basics of training with him themselves so that boundaries, personalities and body language can be learned from each other. He rides good in the car, but has only been with his siblings, never has he been alone. He gets on good with other dogs and would benefit from the companionship in his transition, so a family with another dog would be great, however, if that is not the case, then play-dates with other dogs would be extremely beneficial for him.\\n\\nHe needs an active family and one that will keep his mind stimulated and challenged. Lots of hikes and adventures, training tricks, or agility, dock diving or other fun, active, stimulating activities would be perfect for this boy when his confidence and trust has been gained. Although I have not seen him with children, given time and space his demeanor and personality I have no doubt that he would be great with them and I am sure they could keep each other entertained for many hours.Throughout all that this beautiful soul has been through, he has not once shown any kind of aggression.\\n\\nHUA-HUA is available for adoption from Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue which is located in Sebec, Maine, for an adoption fee of $1,200.

      "Meet the Hobbit litter! These adorable Basset Hound mixes are all about 4 months old and about 30 pounds each. Each sibling in this litter looks a bit different. Tolkien has the longest legs and is the most athletic. Bilbo is the most confident, affectionate one and will run up to you. Belladonna is the only girl. She is very sweet, reserved, and cute. All these pups are crate trained and walk wonderfully on the leash. They do well with other dogs and cats. They would each make perfect family companions too! All these sweethearts need now are forever families to call their own.\\n\\nThe Hobbit Litter is spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, and microchipped. \\n\\nHome for Good Dog Rescue (HFGDR) is a 100 percent foster-based rescue located in Summit with offices in Berkeley Heights, NJ. All of our dogs live in loving local foster homes until they find forever families of their own. Our fosters begin basic training, housebreaking, and leash walking skills to help pair you with the perfect pup for life! \\n\\nWe update Petfinder and our website multiple times daily, so if a dog is available on Petfinder and our website they are still available for adoption. We process all our applications in the order we receive them, and for that reason sometimes the dog or dogs in whom you are interested in may be adopted before your own processing concludes.\\n\\nIn order to apply for adoption and set up an individual meet and greet with one of our dogs, please visit us at www.HomeforGoodDogs.org. \\n\\nFind us on Facebook at

      "Merlin was surrendered by his owner after 5 years. The family had grown from one baby to 4 children under five years old with the related noise and chaos and Merlin, being very stressed, began growling and nipping. Up until that point in time, the owner said that he had been a great dog. While he has been a little reactive with other dogs, Merlin has done well in foster care. He is about 5 years old and weighs just over 14 pounds. We think that he would do well in a quiet home as an only dog, with perhaps only adults, and a fenced-in backyard for exercise. He likes chasing balls, playing tug of war and playing with squeaky toys. He is crate trained and seems to be housetrained.\\n\\nMerlin is neutered, he is up to date on his vaccinations (rabies, distemper and kennel cough), vet checked, heartworm tested negative and on preventative while in rescue, and microchipped.  If you would like to meet Merlin, go to www.cominischnauzerrescue.com and complete the on-line adoption application.  We suggest that you print a copy of the application before you hit the \\\"submit\\\" button, just in case!  We will give you a call to set up a time to bring Merlin for a visit.

      "This guy loves to be outside so a person w/ a lot of outdoor time and then snuggly time is his Zazu's ideal home.  But he is for EXPERIENCED adopters only, preferably 1-2 people in the home and no children and not a City environment.  \\n\\n5y 38lb Zazu fka Zebracake is a good looking gent, reasonably well groomed and dressed in a lush dark chocolate and black coat. His amber eyes light up his face. His muzzle is very slightly grey, and his mouth opens often into a lovely smile. Zazu is a little shy in his kennel, but gets leashed fairly rapidly. He is a very good walker, marks a little his territory, and eyes the pigeons as well as the squirrels in the park. Well, he is just doing his job, as he is part of the herding group of dogs. Zazu does not mind being stared at by me and the camera. He will sit on command, and is not at all interested in my treats that I thought were quite tasty. He seems to like my caresses all over his body. He is a really very gentle and well-mannered pooch. As we were early visitors at a nearby park, we did not meet many dogs, and those we encountered did not elicit much attention from Zazu.  He is an easy going character, friendly, a little shyÃ¢Â€Â“at least inside our wallsÃ¢Â€Â“and a lovely Collie/Retriever mix who is sure to attract connoisseurs of the breeds. \\n\\nFacebook: Zani's Furry Friends ZFF (weekly adoption event info posted here)\\nInstagram: zanisfurryfriends \\nTwitter: zanisff \\n\\nPlease fill out an application in copy/paste format into the body of the email at http://zanisfurryfriends.org and return to dogs@zanisfurryfriends.org \\n\\nMany of us (cats/dogs) will be on display on Sundays and sometimes on Saturdays--please ask by writing us at dogs@zanisfurryfriends.org and following us on FB. If you are seriously interested in adopting one of us in particular, please fill out an application by Friday so that we can be sure to be there. Otherwise we decide based on other variables. Usually we are in our foster homes or in boarding so this is a bit more stressful and a slightly artificial environment but we do want to be seen and find our furever homes too.\\n\\nPlease consider providing a home for more than one dog, especially if you are considering adopting a puppy. Dogs are pack animals and very much enjoy as well as need other dog company to learn to play, socialize and be good companion animals to people. The upside to this is that you won't feel as guilty leaving them alone and you get twice the love. Please come! And if you can't adopt, maybe you can foster or volunteer, and you can always donate!

      "Meet the Hobbit litter! These adorable Basset Hound mixes are all about 4 months old and about 30 pounds each. Each sibling in this litter looks a bit different. Tolkien has the longest legs and is the most athletic. Bilbo is the most confident, affectionate one and will run up to you. Belladonna is the only girl. She is very sweet, reserved, and cute. All these pups are crate trained and walk wonderfully on the leash. They do well with other dogs and cats. They would each make perfect family companions too! All these sweethearts need now are forever families to call their own.\\n\\nThe Hobbit Litter is spayed/neutered, up-to-date on vaccinations, and microchipped. \\n\\nHome for Good Dog Rescue (HFGDR) is a 100 percent foster-based rescue located in Summit with offices in Berkeley Heights, NJ. All of our dogs live in loving local foster homes until they find forever families of their own. Our fosters begin basic training, housebreaking, and leash walking skills to help pair you with the perfect pup for life! \\n\\nWe update Petfinder and our website multiple times daily, so if a dog is available on Petfinder and our website they are still available for adoption. We process all our applications in the order we receive them, and for that reason sometimes the dog or dogs in whom you are interested in may be adopted before your own processing concludes.\\n\\nIn order to apply for adoption and set up an individual meet and greet with one of our dogs, please visit us at www.HomeforGoodDogs.org. \\n\\nFind us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/HomeForGoodDogRescue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    9\n",
      "weight: \\nestimated age: \\n\\nThis dog arrived on 8/10/19 and is just settling in.  If you are interested in adopting, you MUST come in person during adoption hours and fill out an application.  Adoption hours and address are viewable on the website at www.smallmiraclesrescue.org\\n\\n\\n---FAQ---\\n\\nIs This Dog Currently Available?... This dog is available at the Small Miracles rescue facility in Ellicott City.  To submit an application, please come meet this dog in person.  You can bring your application with you, or you can fill one out when you come in.  Dogs will be removed from PetFinder only when they have an approved application or more than three (3) interested applicants.\\n\\nWhere did this dog come from?...  We rescue dogs from 100% kill shelters in West Virginia and on occasion from Kentucky.  On rare occasions we accept owner surrenders.  Due to the nature of the shelters they were rescued from, we often do not know the dogs' history.\\n\\nHow Old is this dog?...  We look at a dogs' teeth to estimate its age, and then the age is reevaluated by our veterinary staff when the dog is spayed/neutered.  If an age is not posted online, please feel free to inquire.\\n\\nIs this dog Good With Kids?...  We occasionally know for sure if a dog is good with kids because it came from a home with kids.  This is rare.  We always suggest you bring your children in to meet the dog if you are seriously interested in adopting.  Dogs may like some kids and may dislike others.  Dogs are individuals, just like kids are.\\n\\nIs this dog Housebroken?...  Advice from a veterinarian:  Even if a dog is housebroken at my house, it does not mean that it understands not to pee at someone else's house.  It ONLY understands not to pee at my house.  Some dogs make the connection that they should only pee outside.  Some must be retrained when they come home.  All we can tell you for sure is whether/or not a dog's crate is clean when we come to walk them in the AM.  All this means is that they are crate trained and waited to pee until we took them outside.\\n\\nWhat is this dog's Temperament?...  We do not have a clear picture of a dog's temperament until we have allowed them to settle in for a few days.  Even then they are living in a shelter environment with many other dogs and a lot of daily activity.  It can be difficult to say a dog is \\\"calm\\\" or \\\"nervous\\\" when the shelter environment is playing a big role in that behavior.  We only rescue FRIENDLY dogs who have no known bite history.  If a dog is at Small Miracles, it likes people and has a good temperament.  We always suggest you meet the dog to see if it is the right fit for your lifestyle. \\n\\nWhat are your Fees?...  Base adoption fee is $325 for adult dogs and puppies.  To this, we add a $30 microchip fee, which we register for you, and a 6 month supply of heartworm preventative.  Heartworm preventative costs $40-60 depending on the weight of the dog.  This means that a large dog will total $405.00 and an extra large dog will total $415.00.\\n\\nWhy can't I adopt a FREE dog?...  Our adoption fee covers many procedures which cost much more for us then the amount we ask for from you. We spay/neuter all pets, and we give them their first round of vaccines (canine distemper, bordatella, Rabies if age appropriate).  At a typical vet clinic this would cost you $500 at minimum for the surgery, and each vaccine is roughly $35 each.  Even if your adopted dog does not have all of its shots due to the mandatory waiting period between booster shots, we offer vaccinations at the low cost of $20/shot.  We test all dogs for heartworm disease and tickborn illnesses such as Lymes.  We never euthanize a heartworm positive dog, and treatment routinely costs us $3000/dog.  We collect a fecal sample from every rescued dog and run a microscopic parasite test.  Any parasites found will be treated with two rounds of the appropriate dewormer.  We treat all dogs for fleas and ticks with Advantage.  If a dog has significant dental disease or \\\"very dirty teeth\\     8\n",
      "Welcome, Miss Winter Vale. Winter is approximately 2 years old and weighs about 60 lbs. \\n\\nBACKGROUND:  This pretty girl ended up in rescue after her person passed away suddenly leaving her with no one to take care of her. Understandably, Winter is a little lost and confused, but we are going to help this girl find her person again. Could that be you? We are not sure of her past life with her previous owner but we suspect that she may have been shaved at one time as her fur is starting to come back in as well.  \\n\\nLIKES:  She loves to have her ears scratched, chase balls and, yes! Do zoomies when she is excited, even in the living room! She initially is excited on her walks and will pull on the leash. She is learning that pulling makes the walking stop and is making progress. She is decompressing & settling in the new environment. Winter is a great traveler in the car and loves to go where ever you may be headed. \\n\\nWinter is looking for someone who can spoil her and give her all the attention she needs. She enjoys attention & will throw paw to ask for it. She prefers to be the only dog in the home. \\n\\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering Winter, please contact CHAAMP at CHAAMPapplication@gmail.com for an application. You may also complete an application online thru our web site, www.CHAAMP.org\\n\\nCHAAMP accepts applications ONLY from Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington DC. The information on your application will help CHAAMP determine which of our dogs is a good match for you and your family, based upon your lifestyle, other pets, etc. A home visit is required prior to all adoptions. Many of our dogs are fostered in private homes and cannot be visited until you have been approved for adoption. \\n\\nADOPTION FEES\\n~Adult dogs, the fee is $275.00  \\n~Older dogs (eight years old or over) the adoption fee is $100.00 \\n~Puppies between 6 months and 1 year are $350.00 \\n~Puppies under 6 months old are $375.00 \\n\\nAll dogs are micro chipped, spayed and neutered and up to date on vaccines. These fees help us cover these costs.  The rates are higher for puppies because they require more visits to the vet and shots. \\n\\nCHAAMP IS NOT A SHELTER.

      "Although he often has a stoic look on his face, Conan absolutely loves people and wants to sit in your lap. Originally rescued from Hurricane Harvey in Houston, Texas, Conan went to two other rescue organizations before coming to Best Friends for help with various medical needs. Conan really needed help getting his allergies under control, and with a lot of hard work and structure, he's finally on the upswing. He is very food motivated and ready to learn new tricks or practice nose work, a fun search and scenting sport. He does tend to shred toys and eat them, so hard toys and chews are best for him. He is crate trained, so he is fine with hanging out in a crate when he is unattended or for nap time. Born in 2009, Conan really likes playing with dogs at the Sanctuary! His food allergies are currently being managed with a prescription diet, which he enjoys, and an occasional bath.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "Willow is a great dog that deserves a forever home after a very rough start.   When she went to the vet to be spayed, they discovered a foreign object in her body.  We were all shocked and our hearts hurt for Willow,   Despite what happened to her, she LOVES people.  She has a good heart and will make a great companion to accompany her person wherever life takes them.\\n \\nWillow is a very friendly girl who loves attention from her foster family.  She prefers the company of people and would be a great only dog.  She rides calmly in the car, sleeps quietly in her kennel at night and walks well on a leash.\\n  \\nWillow loves to play fetch.  She will play non-stop to the point of exhaustion of either herself or your arm.  She can even catch the ball after one bounce!  We think she could be a great Frisbee dog!\\n\\nWillow is a lovely Australian shepherd mix that is about a two years old.  She has a shiny black coat with brown outlines.  She weighs about 45 pounds.   She is spayed, micro-chipped and up to date on vaccines,   She is located in Houston, TX and will come to her new home on professional transport,   For an app, please email rhondabarron@earthlink.net\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",

If you feel like you could be that family please contact Freedom Street Rescue at rhondabarron@earthlink.net for an app.   Ed is located in Houston, TX and will come to his new home on professional ground transport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

I love human attention and petting and I am so grateful I give back all my love! \\nI am crate  and house trained. Im still working on my leash training but Im so petite its not a major issue and I know IÃ¢Â€Â™ll be perfect once I bond with my forever human! \\nI am located in Houston, TX and would come to you on professional ground transport.\\nIf you are interested in being my best friend for life, fill out an application by cutting and pasting this link into your browser or scanning the Qr code from my picture which will take you to an adoption application in Microsoft Forms. \\n\\nhttps://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=DQSIkWdsW0yxEjajBLZtrQAAAAAAAAAAAAMAABcImNdUQkhCODBaSkVLS0w5MVkwVFdEQU5RVEFHUi4u\\n\\nThanks for your interest in adopting a rescue dog!\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
      "This guy loves to be outside so a person w/ a lot of outdoor time and then snuggly time is his Zazu's ideal home.  But he is for EXPERIENCED adopters only, preferably 1-2 people in the home and no children and not a City environment.  \\n\\n5y 38lb Zazu fka Zebracake is a good looking gent, reasonably well groomed and dressed in a lush dark chocolate and black coat. His amber eyes light up his face. His muzzle is very slightly grey, and his mouth opens often into a lovely smile. Zazu is a little shy in his kennel, but gets leashed fairly rapidly. He is a very good walker, marks a little his territory, and eyes the pigeons as well as the squirrels in the park. Well, he is just doing his job, as he is part of the herding group of dogs. Zazu does not mind being stared at by me and the camera. He will sit on command, and is not at all interested in my treats that I thought were quite tasty. He seems to like my caresses all over his body. He is a really very gentle and well-mannered pooch. As we were early visitors at a nearby park, we did not meet many dogs, and those we encountered did not elicit much attention from Zazu.  He is an easy going character, friendly, a little shyÃ¢Â€Â“at least inside our wallsÃ¢Â€Â“and a lovely Collie/Retriever mix who is sure to attract connoisseurs of the breeds. \\n\\nFacebook: Zani's Furry Friends ZFF (weekly adoption event info posted here)\\nInstagram: zanisfurryfriends \\nTwitter: zanisff \\n\\nPlease fill out an application in copy/paste format into the body of the email at http://zanisfurryfriends.org and return to dogs@zanisfurryfriends.org \\n\\nMany of us (cats/dogs) will be on display on Sundays and sometimes on Saturdays--please ask by writing us at dogs@zanisfurryfriends.org and following us on FB. If you are seriously interested in adopting one of us in particular, please fill out an application by Friday so that we can be sure to be there. Otherwise we decide based on other variables. Usually we are in our foster homes or in boarding so this is a bit more stressful and a slightly artificial environment but we do want to be seen and find our furever homes too.\\n\\nPlease consider providing a home for more than one dog, especially if you are considering adopting a puppy. Dogs are pack animals and very much enjoy as well as need other dog company to learn to play, socialize and be good companion animals to people. The upside to this is that you won't feel as guilty leaving them alone and you get twice the love. Please come!

      "Liberty came to us on the 3rd of July - she had been picked up as a stray by animal control and no one ever came looking for her at the shelter. Probably because she had a very large hernia as well as a second hernia and needed medical care ASAP. We got her the care she needed - her intestines were in those hernias! Thankfully she did well in surgery and recovered well. Our vet thought her heart looked enlarged on X-ray but she saw a cardiologist and had an echocardiogram and they said her heart is shaped normally, not enlarged, and that other than having very mild valve disease (common for her breed) sheÃ¢Â€Â™s in great shape Ã¢Â€Â“ no medicine, no restrictions! But she's fun, happy, playful and super excited about life! She loves to ride in the car- she explores everywhere and looks out the windows to flirt with other drivers! She is food protective - she will guard it from people and other dogs (she barks & growls at the other dogs to keep them away and blocks them) so she may need to be fed separately if her forever home has other dogs and a home without small children would be best for her. She is estimated to be about 8-9 years old (shelter originally guessed around 5 but our vet thinks she's older than that). She weighs 7 pounds. She is not completely housetrained. She has a potty pad in her area where she eats and sleeps and has used it occasionally (less as time goes by) and when she comes out of her area and runs to the door, if you're not quick enough or if she gets distracted and runs away from the door, she sometimes squats to potty before you can get her outside. But she's doing better than when she first arrived! She's spunky and loves to dance! If you are interested in adopting from Recycled Doggies, please complete an adoption application through our website:  www.recycleddoggies.org. THAT IS THE FIRST STEP IN OUR PROCESS. Please do not just show up at an adoption event and expect to adopt a dog that day - we need time to review your application ahead of time, which is why we ask that you submit your application ahead of time so you don't miss out on the dog you are hoping to adopt while you wait for your application to be reviewed. Our adoption fee is $195.  All of our dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on age-appropriate vaccines, dewormed, heartworm tested (if over 9 months of age), and microchipped. We do not adopt outside our area, which we define as two hours drive time from downtown Cincinnati (zip code 45202 - use Google Maps to determine if you are within our area) NO EXCEPTIONS. This is for the safety of our dogs, so that in case an adoption does not work out, we can be sure that we can quickly get our dog back. We do not have a shelter or facility - all of our dogs live in volunteer foster homes. In order to not infringe on any more of the time of our foster families, we introduce our dogs to potential adopters at our weekend adoption events posted on our website - please do not request to meet the dog outside of an adoption event as we are unable to grant the request.  If you have additional questions, please email recycleddoggies@gmail.com.\n",

      "Maddie is our little Miss Cutie Patootie! She is a short and stocky malamute girl with so much personality. She is guaranteed to make you smile every day with her paw up for high fives and zoomies. Maddie was born October 2011. She is easy and independent. She is called a little miss spit fire, because she is a tough little cookie! She is sassy and all malamute. She enjoys being in her crate and doesn't make a peep. Or hanging outside watching everyone and everything. She also enjoys hiking and just loves the outdoors! She is also happy just laying around on her doggy bed and just being in the same room as you. Don't let that adorable teddy bear look fool you, she isn't a cuddler and prefers her space, EXCEPT when salmon treats are involved. She will come right up to you, give you high fives and show so much excitement for treat time! Just give her space and time to get to know you. She had a very rough life and is hesitant to trust people. Despite this, she sits nicely to put her collar on before going on a walk. She also rides well in car but generally speaking, Maddie doesn't just do things willingly, which is why positive training works well for her. KronchUSA salmon treats really help us encourage Maddie to make good choices. She likes to protest a little bit just enough so she feels like she had a choice.  \n",
      "\n",
      "She will roll over for belly rubs and come up to you for some love but when shes had enough she will leave and go about her business. She was potty trained at one time but will need a refresher. She does not like other dogs but can be around them. If given the chance she will let other dogs know she is boss and that's why we recommend her as being the only dog in the home. When you are out on a walk she won't get upset seeing another dog as long as they are behaving. She isn't dog aggressive but won't back down from a challenge either. \n",
      "\n",
      "In May 2017, Maddie had ACL surgery on her right knee and is doing well. Of note, she was debarked as a pup so she doesn't have her 'woowoo' but don't let that stop you from giving this girl her second chance. She needs a home with Northern Breed experience. She has a strict limited ingredient diet --- salmon only protein and fat. Typical malamute she cannot be around small dogs or pets including cats. \n",

      "Born in August 2014, Bucky has a great sense of humor and is full of personality.  He would love to be your hiking companion followed by a picnic with a chicken sandwich. He LOVES car rides and visiting the nearby pet stores where all the goodies are. Bucky is a very social Malamute/Husky mix and would love a family of his own. He is a free spirit who responds beautifully to pawsitive communication. He enjoys chasing and burying balls (especially squeaky balls) and really enjoys going out on hikes exploring. He has separation anxiety and would do best in a home with a stay at home human. He is an amazing boy with high predatory behavior that can spot any critter or find deer. With cheerful redirection, he will give up the chase to stay with his human.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bucky is always ready for an adventure but we believe he is trying to find his furever home. Bucky will behave so well, then out of the blue it's like he has to celebrate being good and will surprise you with the fastest zoomies!  However, this is far and few these days. He enjoys just being where you are & hanging out. He has been receiving positive training and has learned to redirect his excitement by sitting for a treat and sitting so the car door opens for an adventure. Most recently he is learning to relax, which he enjoys with chicken sandwich bite size rewards. Bucky looks like a very tall Siberian Husky. Bucky would benefit from pawsitive reinforcement training classes and someone with a good sense of humor. Bucky just wants to have fun, so learning how to communicate being consistent & calm works great for Bucky, especially with a soft yummy treat. \n",
      "\n",
      "With so much to give, he definitely will make someone happy once he settles in and knows he's loved. He prefers to be the only pet in the home...who doesn't like to be the star of the show?!?!  We recommend reading, Positive Perspectives 2 - Know your Dog Train your Dog by Pat Miller.  This book will open your eyes from a dogs perspective & help you communicate & train in a pawsitive manner.  To know Bucky is to love Bucky. He is such a sweet boy who is searching for his furever home & hooman. Those who meet Bucky can't believe that he hasn't been adopted.  \n",
